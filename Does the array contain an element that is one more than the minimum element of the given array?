question
Write a function includeGreaterThanMin that takes a non-empty arr array as an argument and returns true if the array contains 
an element that is one more than the minimum element, and false otherwise.
Example:
the includeGreaterThanMin ([1, 3, 4, 5]) function must return false, since the minimum element is 1 and the array does not contain 2;
the includeGreaterThanMin ([0, 1, 2, 3]) function must return true, since the minimum element is 0 and the array contains 1;
the includeGreaterThanMin ([9, -2, 10, -1, 8]) function should return true, since the minimum element is -2 and the array contains -1.

solution:

function includeGreaterThanMin(arr){
  let a = Math.min(...arr);
  return arr.includes(a + 1);
}
