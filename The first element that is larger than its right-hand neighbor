question
Write a function firstBigger that takes a numeric array arr as an argument and returns the first element of the array 
that is larger than its right-hand neighbor, or undefined if the array is in ascending order.
Examples:
the firstBigger ([0, 8, 4, 1]) function must return 8 (since 8> 4 is the first element of the array that is greater than the next element);
the firstBigger ([1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 15]) function must return undefined (since the elements are in ascending order,
the array does not contain an element that is greater than the next element);
the firstBigger ([]) function must return undefined.


solution:


function firstBigger(arr){
   for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      if(arr[i] > arr[i + 1]){
      return arr[i];
      }
    }
return undefined;
}
